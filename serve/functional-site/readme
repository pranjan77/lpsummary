/*
 *  Landing Page App 
 *
 *  Right now, this file is responsible for landing page URLs
 *  and which controllers and templates are used.
 *
 *  The app uses angular.js, a MVC front-end framework.
 *
 *  -- Some of the critical files --
 *  App:               js/app.js
 *  Controllers:       js/controllers.js
 *  Directives:        js/directives.js 
 *                     js/card-directives.js

You can run the functional site anywhere by:
1) git clone kbase@git.kbase.us:ui-common.git  <whatever_path>
2) point nginx or apache to  <whatever_path>
3) The codes uses the production urls for workspaces and fba by default.  To use different urls, edit <whatever_path>/functional-site/config.json.  i.e., in config.json, change the value of 'setup' to 'wsdev', instead of 'prod', and then it will use these urls:

    "wsdev": { "workspace_url": "http://140.221.84.209:7058",
               "fba_url" : "http://kbase.us/services/KBaseFBAModeling/",
               "user_job_state_url": "http://140.221.84.180:7083" }
