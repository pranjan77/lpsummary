/**
 * This is a simple template for building KBase Widgets.
 * KBase Widgets are based around the jQuery widget extension architecture,
 * and are also instantiated as such.
 *
 * Your widget will need (at minimum) a unique name, a parent to inherit 
 * from, a semantic version, an 'options' structure, and an init() function
 * that returns itself.
 *
 * Details are described below.
 *
 * Instantiating a widget is done using a code form like this:
 * $("#myElement").MyWidget({ option1: value1, option2:value2 });
 *
 * @public
